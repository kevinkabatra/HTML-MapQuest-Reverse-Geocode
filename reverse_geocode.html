        <h1>Example Reverse Geocoding</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: "Reverse Geocoding is the 
            process of back (reverse) coding of a point location (latitude, 
            longitude) to a readable address or place name. This permits the 
            identification of nearby street addresses, places, and/or area 
            subdivisions such as neighborhoods, county, state, or country. 
            Combined with Geocoding and routing services, reverse Geocoding is 
            a critical component of mobile location-based services and Enhanced 
            911 to convert a coordinate obtained by GPS to a readable street 
            address which is easier to understand by the end user." 
            <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            This example combines the HTML Geolocation API with MapQuest's 
            Open Geocoding Service. The HTML Geolocation API always responds
            with the user's longitude and latitude coordinates. This response
            is then sent to MapQuest, which will reply with a JSON message that
            contains a readable address.
        </p>
        <div>
            <p id="latlong">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Your latitude and longitude according to HTML Geolocation is: 
            </p>
            <p id="address">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                According to MapQuest, you are in: </p>
